# Project Daylight: Branding & Naming Analysis

*Research conducted November 2024*

---

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes branding strategy for Project Daylight—an AI-powered evidence and timeline platform for parents navigating high-stakes family court situations. The app transforms chaotic documentation into court-ready evidence through effortless capture, automatic organization, and intelligent analysis.

**Key Finding:** The current competitive landscape is dominated by *co-parenting communication apps* (OurFamilyWizard, TalkingParents, AppClose, 2houses). Project Daylight occupies a fundamentally different space—**personal evidence documentation for court**—which is both an opportunity and a positioning challenge.

## Understanding Your User

### Who They Are

Your primary user is a parent in an active custody dispute who needs to:
- Document incidents as they happen (often while exhausted or emotional)
- Organize evidence scattered across texts, emails, photos, and verbal interactions
- Create court-ready materials that lawyers and judges can use
- Track patterns of behavior over time
- Prepare for GAL (Guardian ad Litem) interviews and court appearances

### Their Emotional State

This is critical for branding. Your user is typically:

| State | Implication for Branding |
|-------|-------------------------|
| **Exhausted** | Need simplicity, not complexity |
| **Anxious** | Need calm reassurance, not urgency |
| **Overwhelmed** | Need "one thing at a time," not feature overload |
| **Defensive** | Need neutral language, not combative framing |
| **Scared** | Need strength, not sympathy |
| **Isolated** | Need professional support, not community |

### What They're Searching For

Likely Google searches:
- "how to document custody issues"
- "evidence for custody case"
- "app to track co-parent behavior"
- "custody journal app"
- "document incidents for court"
- "voice recorder for custody"

### The Unspoken Need

Your user doesn't just need a tool—they need **credibility**. When they walk into court, they want to look like someone who has their life together, who is organized, who is reasonable. The app should make them *feel* more capable and prepared.

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors (Co-Parenting Apps)

These apps focus on **two-party communication** between separated parents. They assume both parties want to cooperate.

#### 1. OurFamilyWizard

*[Screenshot captured: OurFamilyWizard's clean, family-focused homepage with teal color scheme, calendar/expense log UI, and "The leading app for more peaceful co-parenting" tagline]*

**Website:** https://www.ourfamilywizard.com/

**Overview:**
- Market leader, founded 2001
- 1M+ parents and professionals
- Court-recommended in all 50 states
- 4.5 stars, 78.9k ratings

**Branding Analysis:**
- **Name:** Descriptive but long ("Our" + "Family" + "Wizard")
- **Tone:** Cooperative, family-first, magical/helpful ("wizard")
- **Colors:** Teal/blue (trust, calm, professionalism)
- **Tagline:** "The leading app for more peaceful co‑parenting"
- **Messaging:** Emphasizes "peaceful," "accountable," "conflict reduction"

**Key Features:**
- Calendar sharing
- Expense tracking
- ToneMeter AI (rewrites hostile messages)
- Documented messaging
- Info Bank

**Pricing:** Premium subscription model

**What They Get Right:**
- Professional, court-credible positioning
- "Trusted by 1,000,000+ parents and professionals"
- Clean, non-emotional design

**Gap:** Assumes cooperation. If your co-parent won't use the app, it's useless.

### Market Gap Analysis

| Feature | OFW | Talking Parents | AppClose | 2houses | **Daylight** |
|---------|-----|-----------------|----------|---------|--------------|
| Two-party communication | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Voice capture | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| AI transcription | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Screenshot/photo OCR | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| AI event extraction | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Timeline visualization | Partial | Partial | Partial | Partial | ✅ |
| Court-ready PDF export | ❌ | Records only | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Pattern detection | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| One-party use | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

**The Opportunity:**

Daylight is NOT a co-parenting communication app. It's a **personal evidence documentation system** that works regardless of whether the other party cooperates.

This is a completely different product category.

---

## Brand Positioning

### Positioning Statement (Draft)

> For parents in custody disputes who need to document and organize evidence, Daylight is an AI-powered evidence platform that automatically transforms voice notes, screenshots, and documents into court-ready timelines. Unlike co-parenting apps that require both parties to cooperate, Daylight works for you alone—giving you the power to tell your story with facts, not frustration.

### Brand Personality Matrix

| Attribute | Avoid | Target | Why |
|-----------|-------|--------|-----|
| **Emotional** | Sympathetic, hand-holding | Calm, professional, empowering | Users need strength, not pity |
| **Visual** | Dramatic, dark, legal imagery | Clean, minimal, neutral | Credibility without drama |
| **Tone** | Aggressive ("win your case!") | Factual ("organize your truth") | Courts value objectivity |
| **Complexity** | Feature-heavy marketing | Benefit-focused simplicity | Overwhelmed users need clarity |
| **Trust** | Startup-y, trendy | Established, professional | Legal context demands credibility |

### Key Messages

1. **Primary:** "From chaos to clarity"
2. **Secondary:** "Your story, documented"
3. **Tertiary:** "AI-powered organization for court-ready evidence"

---

## Name Analysis & Recommendations

### Current Name: "Project Daylight" / "Daylight"

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Evokes clarity, truth, transparency ("bringing things to light")
- ✅ Short enough to work as "Daylight"
- ✅ No direct legal/custody terms (avoids being too niche)
- ✅ Positive connotation (hope, clarity)
- ✅ Domain availability likely decent

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ "Project" makes it sound unfinished/beta
- ❌ May be confused with daylight saving, outdoor apps, lighting products
- ❌ Doesn't immediately convey purpose
- ❌ Some energy/productivity apps use "daylight" branding

**Verdict:** "Daylight" (without "Project") is usable but generic. It needs strong supporting messaging to convey what it does.

### Top Name Recommendations

#### 🥇 **Daylight** (Keep Current, Modified)

Drop "Project" and use as standalone. Lean into the metaphor.

**Tagline options:**
- "Bring everything to light"
- "From chaos to clarity"
- "Your story, documented"

**Why it works:**
- Already established in codebase
- Positive, hopeful connotation
- Works for the "truth-telling" positioning
- Short, memorable

**Risk:** Generic enough to have competition in other categories.

---

#### 🥈 **Witness**

Strong, evocative name that positions the user as the observer/documenter.

**Tagline options:**
- "Your truth, witnessed"
- "Document what you see"
- "Be your own witness"

**Why it works:**
- Legal connotation (witness testimony)
- Empowering (you are the observer)
- Single word, memorable
- Domain: witness.app likely available

**Risk:** Could feel slightly dramatic or religious to some.

---

#### 🥉 **Evident**

Double meaning—"evidence" and "obvious/clear."

**Tagline options:**
- "Make it evident"
- "The truth is evident"
- "Your evidence, organized"

**Why it works:**
- Direct tie to evidence
- Professional sound
- Clean, simple

**Risk:** Could feel clinical, missing emotional hook.

---

#### Honorable Mention: **Recall**

Memory retrieval + documentation + legal testimony.

**Tagline:** "Perfect recall for imperfect situations"

**Risk:** Association with product recalls (negative).

---

## Visual Identity Considerations

### Color Psychology for Legal/Evidence Apps

| Color | Association | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Navy/Dark Blue** | Trust, authority, professionalism | Primary brand color |
| **White/Off-white** | Clarity, cleanliness, truth | Backgrounds |
| **Warm Gray** | Neutrality, sophistication | Secondary elements |
| **Amber/Gold** | Warmth, optimism (subtle) | Accents only |
| **Avoid: Red** | Anger, conflict, danger | Wrong tone entirely |
| **Avoid: Purple** | Creative, mystical | Too playful |
| **Avoid: Bright colors** | Childish, unserious | Wrong context |

### Typography Recommendations

- **Headlines:** Strong, professional serif OR clean geometric sans
- **Body:** Highly legible sans-serif (system fonts work)
- **Avoid:** Trendy/stylized fonts, script fonts, anything "fun"

### Logo Direction

Given the subject matter, the logo should be:
- **Simple:** Icon + wordmark, not complex illustration
- **Geometric:** Clean shapes (circle, square, simple lines)
- **Symbolic:** Could incorporate: light/sun rays, timeline, document, shield

**Avoid:**
- Gavel imagery (too cliché, aggressive)
- Family/parent imagery (too specific, could feel exclusionary)
- Lock/shield (too security-app)
- Scales of justice (too legal-firm)

---

## Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. **The "Warrior Parent" Trap** 🚫

**The temptation:** Position as a weapon to "win" custody battles.

**Why it fails:**
- Courts view combative parents negatively
- Attracts wrong user psychology
- Legal liability concerns
- Alienates attorneys who might recommend

**Instead:** Position as organization and documentation, not warfare.

---

### 2. **The "Sympathy" Trap** 🚫

**The temptation:** Lean into emotional support messaging ("We're here for you in this difficult time").

**Why it fails:**
- Users need strength, not pity
- Comes across as patronizing
- Doesn't differentiate from therapy apps
- Undercuts professional credibility

**Instead:** Acknowledge difficulty briefly, then focus on empowerment through organization.

---

### 3. **The "Legal Advice" Trap** 🚫

**The temptation:** Use terminology that implies legal guidance ("Protect your rights," "Build your case").

**Why it fails:**
- Legal liability (unauthorized practice of law)
- Overpromises what app can deliver
- Could harm users who rely on it instead of attorneys

**Instead:** Focus on documentation and organization. Let lawyers interpret.

---

### 4. **The "Victim" Trap** 🚫

**The temptation:** Market to "victims" of bad co-parents, abusive situations.

**Why it fails:**
- Creates adversarial positioning
- May attract users for wrong reasons
- Could be used for false allegations
- Reputational risk

**Instead:** Neutral positioning around documentation and preparation.

---

### 5. **The "Feature Overload" Trap** 🚫

**The temptation:** Market every AI feature, every capability.

**Why it fails:**
- Overwhelms exhausted users
- Dilutes core value proposition
- Sounds like tech, not solution

**Instead:** Lead with outcomes ("court-ready timeline"), not features ("AI transcription").

---

### 6. **The "Custody Only" Trap** 🚫

**The temptation:** Focus branding entirely on custody cases.

**Why it fails:**
- Limits market size
- Same tool could help with:
  - Workplace documentation
  - Medical history tracking
  - Elder care documentation
  - Any legal dispute preparation

**Instead:** Lead with custody (it's the highest-pain market) but keep brand expandable.

---

### 7. **The "Corny Name" Trap** 🚫

Examples of what to avoid:
- **"CustodyWin"** — Too aggressive, overpromises
- **"ParentPower"** — Cheesy, sounds like a supplement
- **"MyEvidenceVault"** — Clunky, keyword-stuffed
- **"TruthKeeper"** — Religious overtones, dramatic
- **"CaseBuilder"** — Sounds like construction software
- **"FamilyFight"** — Yikes. Just no.
- **"CourtReady"** — Generic, keyword-focused

**Why these fail:**
- Sound like they were generated by SEO software
- No emotional resonance
- Lack sophistication
- Won't age well

---

## Recommended Direction

### Primary Recommendation: Stick with "Daylight"

**Rationale:**
1. Already built into codebase and mental model
2. Metaphorically strong (truth, clarity, bringing to light)
3. Doesn't pigeonhole to custody-only
4. Professional without being cold
5. Hopeful without being naive
6. Short, memorable, spellable

**Required changes:**
- Drop "Project" from all marketing
- Develop strong tagline to clarify purpose
- Build visual identity around "light" metaphor
- Secure domains: daylight.app, getdaylight.com, etc.

### Tagline Options (Ranked)

1. **"From chaos to clarity"** — Best overall, captures transformation
2. **"Your story, documented"** — Personal, emphasizes user's narrative
3. **"Court-ready documentation"** — Direct but less emotional
4. **"Organize your truth"** — Good, might feel slightly confrontational
5. **"Bring everything to light"** — Plays on name, but vague

### Voice & Tone Guidelines

| Context | Do | Don't |
|---------|-----|-------|
| **Headlines** | "Turn chaos into court-ready clarity" | "Win your custody battle" |
| **Features** | "Voice capture with AI transcription" | "Revolutionary AI-powered recording" |
| **Benefits** | "Organized timeline your lawyer can use" | "Destroy your ex in court" |
| **Support** | "Here's how to export your timeline" | "We know this is SO hard for you" |
| **Errors** | "Something went wrong. Try again." | "Uh oh! Looks like we hit a snag!" |

### Sample Homepage Messaging

**Hero:**
> # Daylight
> ## From chaos to court-ready clarity
>
> When you're navigating custody disputes, documenting everything can feel impossible. Daylight transforms voice notes, screenshots, and scattered evidence into organized timelines—so you can focus on your kids, not paperwork.
>
> [Start Documenting] [See How It Works]

**Feature blocks:**
- "Capture" → "Record voice notes. We transcribe and timestamp."
- "Organize" → "AI extracts events and builds your timeline."
- "Export" → "One-click PDF reports for attorneys and court."
