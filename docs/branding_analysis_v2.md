# Project Daylight: Branding & Identity Deep Dive (v2)

*Research conducted November 2024*

---

## The Reframe

The first analysis looked at co-parenting app competitors. But that's the wrong lens.

**Project Daylight isn't a co-parenting app. It's a burden-removal tool.**

The real question isn't "How do we look like OurFamilyWizard?" It's:
- How do we feel like **Backblaze** (set it and forget it)?
- How do we sound like **Basecamp** (no-nonsense, effective, reliable)?
- How do we work like **Loom** (just press record)?
- How do we sell like **Calendly** (lawyers give it to clients)?

---

## Part 1: What You're Actually Selling

### Not This:
- ❌ "Help navigating difficult family situations"
- ❌ "AI-powered evidence management platform"
- ❌ "Court-ready documentation for custody battles"
- ❌ "Support for parents in crisis"

### This:
- ✅ **"You don't have to think about this anymore."**
- ✅ **"Talk. We handle the rest."**
- ✅ **"It's done."**

The product isn't evidence management. The product is **relief**.

When someone buys Backblaze, they're not buying "unlimited cloud backup with AES-256 encryption." They're buying **never worrying about losing their files again**.

When someone uses Daylight, they're not buying "AI-powered transcription with timeline extraction." They're buying **the ability to stop carrying this in their head**.

## Part 2: Brand Inspirations (Outside the Category)

### 1. Backblaze — The "Set and Forget" Model

*[Screenshot: Dark gradient background, "Cloud storage built better" in large white type, minimal design]*

**Website:** https://www.backblaze.com/

**What They Do:** Cloud backup and storage

**Why They Matter:**
- They don't sell features. They sell **peace of mind**.
- "I have full trust in Backblaze that, if something were to happen, I could easily retrieve what I need."
- The value prop is **negative**: It's about what you DON'T have to worry about.

**Key Copy:**
- "Cloud storage built better"
- "Unlimited, easy data protection"
- "Enterprise grade platform, accessible for everyone"
- "The world's easiest backup"

**Lesson for Daylight:**
Position around the worry that goes away, not the work that gets done.

---

### 2. Basecamp — The "No-Nonsense" Voice

*[Screenshot: Playful illustration crossing out competing apps, "Wrestling with projects? It doesn't have to be this hard." Bold headline, human copy]*

**Website:** https://basecamp.com/

**What They Do:** Project management

**Why They Matter:**
- Acknowledges the problem without being dramatic
- "You've probably tried some. Yet, here you are."
- Opinionated and confident
- "Basecamp is famously **no-nonsense, effective, and reliable**. The trifecta."

**Key Copy:**
- "It doesn't have to be this hard."
- "Longevity isn't luck — it's proof it works."
- "We'd be honored to have you as a customer."

**Lesson for Daylight:**
Be direct. Acknowledge the pain briefly, then offer the solution without drama. Confidence without arrogance.

---

### 3. Linear — The "Purpose-Built" Positioning

*[Screenshot: Dark UI, clean typography, "Linear is a purpose-built tool for planning and building products"]*

**Website:** https://linear.app/

**What They Do:** Issue tracking for software teams

**Why They Matter:**
- "Purpose-built" = we do one thing, well
- No fluff, no marketing speak
- Design that feels crafted, not cobbled together
- Respected by professionals who use it daily

**Key Copy:**
- "Linear is a purpose-built tool for planning and building products"
- "Meet the system for modern software development"
- "Streamline issues, projects, and product roadmaps"

**Lesson for Daylight:**
"Purpose-built for custody documentation" signals seriousness without being dramatic.

---

### 4. Loom — The "Just Press Record" Simplicity

*[Screenshot: Clean white background, "One video is worth a thousand words," simple CTA buttons]*

**Website:** https://www.loom.com/

**What They Do:** Video recording and sharing

**Why They Matter:**
- Dead simple value prop
- "Easily record and share"
- The complexity is hidden — you just talk
- B2B2C model — teams and individuals both use it

**Key Copy:**
- "One video is worth a thousand words"
- "Easily record and share AI-powered video messages"

**Lesson for Daylight:**
"You just talk into it." That's the entire pitch to lawyers. The AI complexity is invisible to the end user.

---

### 5. Clio — The B2B Legal Channel

*[Screenshot: Professional legal tech aesthetic, "Legal AI that gets it right. Right where you work."]*

**Website:** https://www.clio.com/

**What They Do:** Legal practice management

**Why They Matter:**
- Trusted by law firms
- Professional without being stuffy
- "Legal AI that gets it right"
- Strong B2B positioning with clear value props

**Key Copy:**
- "Legal AI that gets it right. Right where you work."
- "From the first email to the last bill"

**Lesson for Daylight:**
The lawyer channel needs professional credibility. "Our clients use this" has to feel safe to recommend.

---

### 6. 1Password — Security Without Complexity

*[Screenshot: Professional design, "Secure all sign-ins to every application from any device"]*

**Website:** https://1password.com/

**What They Do:** Password management

**Why They Matter:**
- Serious problem, simple solution
- "You don't have to remember anything"
- Works for individuals AND teams/businesses
- The complexity (encryption, sync, etc.) is invisible

**Lesson for Daylight:**
Document everything. Remember nothing. Export when needed. The user doesn't need to understand how it works.

## Part 3: The B2B2C Opportunity

### How It Works

```
Law Firm → Gives to Client → Client uses daily → Data helps case
```

### The Attorney Pitch

> "You know how clients show up with a shoebox of screenshots and half-remembered dates? Give them this instead. They talk into their phone. We turn it into a timeline. You get something you can actually use."

### Key Insights for B2B2C

**What lawyers want:**
- Clients who are organized
- Evidence that's timestamped and credible
- Less back-and-forth asking "when did X happen?"
- Something they can recommend without liability

**What lawyers will SAY to clients:**
- "Use this to document everything"
- "Just talk into it when something happens"
- "Don't worry about organizing it—it does that for you"
- "When we need a timeline, we'll export from here"

### Reference Models

| Product | Professional | End User | Value Exchange |
|---------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| **Calendly** | Salespeople, recruiters | Prospects, candidates | "Use this link to book" |
| **DocuSign** | Legal, HR, sales | Anyone signing | "Please sign this" |
| **HelloSign** | Small businesses | Clients | "Sign and return" |
| **Loom** | Teams | External recipients | "Watch this video" |
| **Typeform** | Marketers, researchers | Survey respondents | "Fill this out" |
| **Daylight** | Attorneys | Clients in custody cases | "Document everything here" |

---

## Part 4: Revised Brand Identity

### Core Attributes

| Attribute | Old Thinking | New Thinking |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Emotional** | "We know this is hard" | "This is handled" |
| **Visual** | Soft, family imagery | Clean, professional, neutral |
| **Voice** | Supportive, empathetic | Confident, direct, reassuring |
| **Complexity** | AI-powered features | Invisible intelligence |
| **Trust** | Security badges, encryption | "Lawyers recommend this" |

### Brand Personality

**Daylight is:**
- **Reliable** — It works. Every time.
- **Invisible** — You talk. It organizes.
- **Professional** — Lawyers recommend it.
- **Calm** — No drama. Just documentation.
- **Honest** — We don't overpromise.

**Daylight is NOT:**
- Sympathetic (we're not a therapist)
- Aggressive (we're not a weapon)
- Cute (we're not a consumer app)
- Complex (we're not enterprise software)
- Emotional (we're not taking sides)

### Voice Examples

| Context | ❌ Don't Say | ✅ Do Say |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Hero** | "We're here to help you through this difficult time" | "Talk. We handle the rest." |
| **Feature** | "AI-powered transcription with NLP-based event extraction" | "You talk. We turn it into a timeline." |
| **Value** | "Win your custody case with organized evidence" | "Your lawyer gets what they need." |
| **Trust** | "Bank-level encryption keeps your data safe" | "Lawyers recommend this to clients." |
| **Support** | "We know how hard this is ❤️" | "Here's how to export your timeline." |

---

## Part 5: Name Reconsideration

### "Daylight" — Revisited

With the new positioning, "Daylight" actually works better than I initially thought.

**Why it fits:**
- Light = clarity (truth, transparency)
- Light = relief (dawn after a dark night)
- Light = simplicity (not heavy, not burdensome)
- "Bring to light" = documentation
- NOT dramatic, NOT aggressive, NOT emotional

**The risk:**
- Generic (other apps use daylight/light metaphors)
- Doesn't immediately signal function

**The fix:**
Strong tagline and positioning that clarifies purpose.

### Alternative Names Worth Considering

| Name | Vibe | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|------|
| **Daylight** | Clarity, relief | Established, positive, expandable | Generic |
| **Noted** | Simple, direct | "It's noted" = acknowledged, recorded | Very common |
| **Record** | Documentary | Direct, simple, professional | Too generic |
| **Docket** | Legal | Legal terminology, professional | Insider jargon |
| **Matter** | Legal-adjacent | "Legal matter" + "it matters" | Could feel pretentious |
| **File** | Simple, archival | "On file," professional | Very generic |

### My Updated Recommendation

Stick with **Daylight**, but lean harder into the "relief/clarity" meaning rather than the "evidence/court" meaning.

The brand shouldn't feel like a legal tool. It should feel like a **burden removed**.

## Part 6: Visual Direction

### Inspiration: "Professional Calm"

Not this: Warm family photos, soft pastels, hearts
Not this: Dark legal imagery, gavels, courtrooms
Not this: Startup-y bright colors, playful illustrations

**This:** Clean, neutral, professional, calm.

### Color Direction

| Element | Color | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| **Primary** | Deep blue-black (#1a1a2e) | Serious, trustworthy, not aggressive |
| **Secondary** | Warm gray (#6b7280) | Neutral, sophisticated |
| **Accent** | Soft amber (#f59e0b) | Warmth without being childish |
| **Background** | Off-white (#fafafa) | Clean, not clinical |
| **Success** | Muted green (#10b981) | Subtle, not celebratory |

### Typography Direction

- **Headlines:** Clean geometric sans (like Inter, but maybe something with more character)
- **Body:** Highly legible, professional
- **Avoid:** Serif (too legal-firm), script (too casual), trendy (won't age)

### Logo Direction

Simple. Could be:
- Abstract mark suggesting light/clarity
- Just the wordmark, well-crafted
- Simple geometric shape (circle, horizon line)

**Avoid:**
- Sun/sunrise (cliché)
- Gavel/scales (too legal)
- Family/parent imagery (too specific)
- Shield/lock (too security-app)

---

## Part 7: Messaging Framework

### The Hierarchy

1. **Benefit** (why care): "Stop carrying this in your head."
2. **How** (what it does): "Talk. We turn it into a timeline."
3. **Proof** (why trust): "Lawyers recommend this to clients."

### Homepage Structure

**Hero:**
```
Talk. We handle the rest.

When you're going through custody proceedings, the last thing 
you need is another task. Daylight turns voice notes into 
organized timelines—so you can focus on what matters.

[Start Documenting]
```

**How it works:**
```
1. Talk into your phone
2. We transcribe and extract events
3. Export when your lawyer needs it

That's it.
```

**For Attorneys:**
```
Give clients something useful.

Stop getting shoeboxes of screenshots. Give your clients 
Daylight. They document as they go. You get timelines you 
can actually use.

[Partner with us]
```

### Tagline Options (Ranked)

1. **"Talk. We handle the rest."** — Direct, benefit-focused, simple
2. **"Document everything. Remember nothing."** — 1Password-style benefit framing
3. **"Your story, organized."** — Personal, less burden-focused
4. **"Stop carrying this in your head."** — Very direct about the relief
5. **"Just talk."** — Ultra-minimal

## Part 8: The "Too Much" / Corny Pitfalls

### What Makes It "Too Much"

| Element | Why It Fails |
|---------|-------------|
| **"Win your custody battle"** | Aggressive, overpromises, bad for court optics |
| **"Protect your children"** | Manipulative, implies the other parent is dangerous |
| **"We're here for you ❤️"** | Patronizing, therapist-voice |
| **"Document the truth"** | Implies the other side is lying (adversarial) |
| **"Your evidence, your power"** | Sounds like an ad for a weapon |
| **Dramatic imagery** | Dark colors, crying parents, courtroom photos |
| **Happy family imagery** | Feels false given the context |

### What Makes It "Corny"

| Element | Why It Fails |
|---------|-------------|
| **"CustodyGuard"** | SEO-keyword-as-name |
| **"MyEvidenceVault"** | Clunky compound word |
| **"TruthKeeper"** | Sounds like a fantasy game |
| **"ParentShield"** | Sounds like antivirus software |
| **Taglines with "™"** | "Document Everything™" — trying too hard |
| **Overuse of "AI-powered"** | Buzzword fatigue |
| **Exclamation points** | "Start protecting yourself today!" — desperate |

### The Sweet Spot

- Confident but not aggressive
- Professional but not corporate
- Helpful but not hand-holding
- Serious but not dramatic
- Simple but not simplistic

---

## Part 9: The Authentic Voice

Based on your input ("authenticity, reliability, simplicity"), here's what the brand should sound like:

### Authentic = Not Performing

**Don't:**
> "At Daylight, we believe every parent deserves to have their story heard. That's why we built an AI-powered platform to transform your experiences into compelling narratives that resonate in the courtroom."

**Do:**
> "You've got enough to deal with. Daylight records what you say, organizes it, and gives you something your lawyer can use. That's it."

### Reliable = It Just Works

**Don't:**
> "Trust our cutting-edge infrastructure to safeguard your most important memories with enterprise-grade security."

**Do:**
> "Record. It saves. Export when you need it. We've never lost anyone's data."

### Simple = No Extra Steps

**Don't:**
> "Getting started is easy! Just create an account, set up your profile, configure your preferences, and you're ready to begin your documentation journey."

**Do:**
> "Sign up. Press record. Talk. Done."

---
