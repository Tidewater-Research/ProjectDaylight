*Last Updated: November 29, 2024*

**Goal: Launch in 2-3 weeks with current features + great experience**

---

## Current Status

### ✅ What's Working
- Voice capture → transcription → event extraction → timeline

- Mobile responsiveness needs testing
- Error handling needs polish
- No monitoring/analytics yet

## PHASE 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1)
*"Make it actually work in production"*

### ✅ Priority 0: Fix Production API/Auth - **COMPLETE**
**THE BLOCKER - SOLVED!**

- [x] **Fixed production deployment**
  - Root cause identified: Wrong JWT field (`user.id` vs `user.sub`)
  - Fixed cookie passing using `useFetch` with `useRequestHeaders(['cookie'])`
  - Added proper Supabase config to `nuxt.config.ts`
  
- [x] **Auth fixes implemented:**
  1. ✅ Added proper Supabase config to `nuxt.config.ts`:
     - `cookieOptions` for session handling
     - `clientOptions` with PKCE flow
     - Correct domain/sameSite for production
  2. ✅ Fixed backend to use `user?.sub` (JWT standard)
  3. ✅ Fixed frontend to pass cookies with `useFetch`
  4. ✅ Created client plugin for session management

- [x] **Pattern applied to all remaining routes & pages:**
  - Backend: Use `user?.sub || user?.id` for user ID
  - Frontend: Use `useFetch` with `useRequestHeaders(['cookie'])`
  - Verified in production for home, timeline, evidence, and case routes after fixing `tslib` runtime issue on Vercel

**Success:** User can record voice note in production → see it in timeline ✅

---

## PHASE 2: Launch Essentials (Week 2)
*"Make it worth paying for"*

### ✅ Priority 1: Image Evidence Storage - COMPLETE
**Persist and surface original images for both OCR-backed and simple photo evidence**

- [x] **Supabase Storage + RLS**
  - Enable/configure the evidence image bucket in Supabase
  - Set up RLS policies so users can only access their own images (per-user folders in `daylight-files`)
  - Use signed URLs for reading images from the frontend
 
- [x] **Persist image files alongside OCR/LLM data**
  - When image evidence is created, store the original image file (whether or not OCR is needed)
  - Save the storage path/URL on the evidence record
  - Ensure existing OCR extraction flow continues to work unchanged for documents that benefit from it
  - For "simple" photo evidence (e.g. pictures of injuries, locations), let the LLM generate an optional short description instead of running full OCR
  
- [x] **UI support for viewing and using stored images**
  - Show image preview/thumbnail on the evidence page
  - Allow opening a full-size image viewer from evidence and/or timeline views
  - Make it clear when an evidence item has an attached image vs. text-only OCR vs. image + LLM description
  - Make it easy to associate image-only evidence with events (full association UX is covered in Priority 2, but UI should not assume OCR is always present)
  
**Success:** ✅ User can upload an image as evidence → app stores it securely in Supabase → user can view that image later from the evidence UI and, whether it's OCR-backed or just a photo with an LLM description, associate it with relevant events.

### 🔄 Priority 2: Evidence-Event Association - COMPLETE
**Connect evidence to timeline events for context**

- [x] **Database schema updates**
  - Create junction table for evidence-event relationships (many-to-many) ✅ `event_evidence` table
  - Add proper foreign keys and RLS policies ✅
  - Migration for new relationship structure ✅
  
- [x] **Event detail page enhancements**
  - Display all evidence associated with an event ✅
  - Quick link to view each piece of evidence ✅
  - Show evidence thumbnails in event card ✅
  
- [x] **Evidence detail page enhancements**
  - Show all events associated with this evidence ✅
  - Timeline context for when evidence was captured vs. events ✅
  
**Success:** ✅ User can link a photo to multiple events → see photo when viewing event → see events when viewing photo (association happens automatically during event extraction, manual add/remove deferred to post-launch)

### ✅ Priority 3: Payments & Billing - COMPLETE
- [x] **Stripe integration**
  - Subscription checkout ($49/month, $495/year)
  - Stripe Customer Portal for payment management
  - Webhook handling for subscription lifecycle
  - Cancel/resume flow via portal
  - Promotion codes supported
  
- [x] **Billing page**
  - Current plan display with status badges
  - Monthly/yearly billing toggle (17% savings on yearly)
  - Upgrade flow with Stripe Checkout
  - "Manage Billing" button to Stripe Portal
  - Free/Alpha/Pro/Counsel (coming soon) plan tiers
  - Alpha tier for early partners (all features, no cost)

### ✅ Priority 4: Landing Page & Branding - COMPLETE
- [x] **Professional landing page**
  - Compelling hero: "Just talk. We handle the rest."
  - 3-step "How it works" section
  - Live demos (voice-to-timeline, evidence extraction animations)
  - Court-ready document preview section
  - "For Attorneys" section with benefits
  - Trust indicators (bank-level encryption, attorney recommended)
  - Clear CTAs: "Start documenting free"
  
- [x] **Brand identity**
  - Consistent color scheme throughout app (Sky blue primary, gray neutral)
  - Professional logo (Nuxt-inspired with bite mark)
  - Complete favicon set (SVG, ICO, PNG 96x96, Apple Touch Icon)
  - Web manifest for PWA support
  - SEO metadata (Open Graph, Twitter cards, Schema.org structured data)
  - [ ] Email templates for auth/billing (deferred)

### ✅ Priority 5: Onboarding & First Experience - COMPLETE
- [x] **Smooth signup flow**
  - Email/password or Google OAuth ✅
  - Immediate access after signup ✅
  - [ ] Welcome email with getting started tips (deferred to post-launch)
  
- [x] **First-use experience**

## Development Philosophy for Launch

### Do's ✅
- Ship with bugs rather than not ship
- Focus on core value: capture → timeline → export
- Make payment easy
- Polish what users see most

### Don'ts ❌
- Add new features before launch
- Perfect the codebase
- Over-engineer solutions
- Wait for perfect conditions

### Remember
**Goal: Get 10 paying customers in first month, not build perfect product**

Every day without paying customers is a day without validation. Launch lean, iterate based on real feedback.
