# Project Daylight - Product Vision & Strategy

*Last Updated: November 2024*

---

## Executive Summary

**Project Daylight** (working name) is an AI-powered evidence and timeline platform designed specifically for parents navigating high-stakes family court situations. It transforms the chaos of divorce, custody disputes, and co-parenting conflicts into clear, court-ready documentation through effortless capture, automatic organization, and intelligent analysis.

### Core Value Proposition
> "Transform exhausted scribbles into court-ready evidence."

### Mission
To bring clarity, order, and insight to parents navigating family court, enabling them to focus on their children rather than paperwork.

---

## The Problem

### Emotional Reality
Parents in custody battles are:
- Exhausted from carrying both parenting and litigation burdens
- Terrified of missing critical evidence
- Overwhelmed by documentation requirements
- Anxious about court perceptions
- Operating at cognitive capacity while emotionally depleted

### Functional Reality
Current solutions fail because:
- Co-parenting apps focus on communication, not evidence
- Note-taking apps lack legal structure
- Lawyers need organized timelines parents can't produce
- Evidence lives scattered across texts, emails, photos, calendars
- No tool connects daily parenting to legal narrative

### Market Gap
**Nobody is building for the exhausted parent who needs a system, not sympathy.**

---

## Product Philosophy

### 1. Zero Friction Capture
*"If it requires effort, it won't get documented."*
- Voice notes while driving
- Screenshot and forget
- Forward and done

### 2. Automatic Intelligence
*"The AI is your paralegal, not your therapist."*
- Extract events from rambling voice notes
- OCR and parse screenshots instantly
- Tag patterns without asking

### 3. Proactive Insights
*"Tell me what matters before I know to ask."*
- Surface contradictions automatically
- Identify documentation gaps
- Predict what judges focus on

### 4. Court-Ready Output
*"From chaos to credible in one click."*
- Generate timeline PDFs
- Package evidence exhibits
- Create GAL response packets

### 5. Calm Neutrality
*"This is about truth, not taking sides."*
- No emotional language
- No "winning" or "losing"
- Just facts, organized

## Design Principles

### Visual Approach
- **Minimal and clean** - Focus on content, not chrome
- **Monochrome base** - Gray scale with semantic colors for status only
- **Standard components** - Use shadcn/ui defaults, don't overthink
- **Information density** - Show more data, less decoration
- **Professional feel** - This is serious software for serious situations

### Interface Guidelines
- No custom fonts or fancy animations
- Clear hierarchy through size and weight
- Generous white space for breathing room
- Status through color: Green (positive), Red (incident), Blue (info)
- Mobile-first but desktop-capable
